<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s make our program with the help of a REST service. To create&nbsp;REST service we will create Spring project using Spring Boot .&nbsp;The following dependencies should be pasted to build.gradle file (in our study project they are already included):&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>spring-boot-starter - Core starter, including auto-configuration support, logging and YAML;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>spring-boot-starter-web - Starter for building web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Tomcat as the default embedded container</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>In this stage, you need to create 3 endpoints that will return information about appointments to the doctor in JSON format.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In the first stage, you need to develop a program that creates appointments to doctor, deletes appointments and shows all set appointments via the API. Implement three&nbsp;endpoints:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1. Implement&nbsp; <code>/setAppointment</code>&nbsp; endpoint that handles POST requests to create new appointment and returns information about the appointment.</h3>

<p>A request should contain the following body:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-json">{
    "doctor": "Name of the doctor",
    "patient": "Name of the patient",
    "date": "date of visite : 2021-12-01"
}</code></pre>

<p>Take these variables and store them for the appointment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Response body should be JSON object&nbsp; as following example ( doctor and patinet in lower ñase):</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-json">{
    "idApp": 1,
    "doctor": "pamela upperson",
    "patient": "john galt",
    "date": "2021-12-01"
}</code></pre>

<ul>
    <li>where name &quot;idApp&quot; is paired with value of unique id assigned to the appointment in Number format,</li>
    <li>name &quot;doctor&quot; is paired with value of doctor name which was in the request body and stored in the appointment with mentioned idApp in String format;</li>
    <li>name &quot;patientName&quot;&nbsp; is paired with value of patient name which was in the request body and stored in the appointment with mentioned idApp in String format;</li>
    <li>name &quot;date&quot;&nbsp; is paired with value of the date of visit&nbsp; which was in the request body and stored in the appointment with mentioned idApp in String format;</li>
</ul>

<p>The endpoint should return&nbsp;Response Status Code 200. If request body has mistakes e.g. lack of atribute or empty name of doctor or patient, or wrong data format the endpoint should return&nbsp;Response Status Code 400.</p>

<h3>2. Implement <code>/deleteAppointment/?id={N}</code>&nbsp; endpoint that handles DELETE requests to delete appointment and returns the information about the appointment deleted.</h3>

<p>To delete an appointment please use&nbsp;id&nbsp; assigned to the appointement when it was created. Use the id as a request parameter.&nbsp;If appointment with requested id exists , delete the appointment and&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;Response Status Code 200.&nbsp;&nbsp;Response body should be JSON object&nbsp; as following example:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-json">{
    "idApp": 1,
    "doctor": "pamela upperson",
    "patient": "john galt",
    "date": "2021-12-01"
}</code></pre>

<ul>
    <li>where name &quot;idApp&quot; is paired with value of unique id assigned to the appointment in Number format,</li>
    <li>name &quot;doctor&quot; is paired with value of doctor name which was in the request body and stored in the appointment with mentioned idApp in String format;</li>
    <li>name &quot;patient&quot;&nbsp; is paired with value of patient name which was in the request body and stored in the appointment with mentioned idApp in String format;</li>
    <li>name &quot;date&quot;&nbsp; is paired with value of the date of visit&nbsp; which was in the request body and stored in the appointment with mentioned idApp in String format;</li>
</ul>

<p>if appointment&nbsp; with&nbsp;requested id&nbsp; does not exists or was deleted then return &nbsp;Response Status Code 400 and JSON object&nbsp; as following example:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-json">{
   "error": "The appointment does not exist or was already cancelled"
}</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>3. Implement <code>/appointments</code> endpoint that handles GET requests and returns the information about all appointments. The endpoint do not accept any body or parameters and return JsonArray&nbsp; with&nbsp; <em>all created &nbsp;appointments.</em></h3>

<p>The endpoint should return&nbsp;Response Status Code 200 if there is any scheduled appointment and &nbsp;Response Status Code 204 if no content;</p>

<p>The response should be as a JSON Array which contains&nbsp; a set of&nbsp; JSON objects. Each&nbsp; JSON object should contain&nbsp; the following&nbsp;name/value pairs:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li>where name &quot;idApp&quot; is paired with value of unique id assigned to the appointment in Number format,</li>
    <li>name &quot;doctor&quot; is paired with value of doctor name which was in the request body and stored in the appointment with mentioned idApp in String format;</li>
    <li>name &quot;patient&quot;&nbsp; is paired with value of patient name which was in the request body and stored in the appointment with mentioned idApp in String format;</li>
    <li>name &quot;date&quot;&nbsp; is paired with value of the date of visit&nbsp; which was in the request body and stored in the appointment with mentioned idApp in String format;</li>
</ul>

<pre>
<code>
[
    {
        "idApp": 7,
        "doctor": "lea wong",
        "patient": "ay bolit",
        "date": "2022-10-30"
    },
    {
        "idApp": 19,
        "doctor": "pamela upperson",
        "patient": "indi grimes",
        "date": "2022-10-30"
    },
    {
        "idApp": 24,
        "doctor": "dr. house",
        "patient": "unknown",
        "date": "2022-10-30"
    }
]
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Request and response entity-header <code>Content-Type </code>&nbsp;of all the API endpoints should be equal to&nbsp;<code>application/json&nbsp;</code>&nbsp;.</p>
